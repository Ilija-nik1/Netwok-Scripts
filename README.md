Some network automation scripts on my journey of learning about networks. Some network configuration automation, network testing scripts and some general network concepts tests for a programmer learning about networks.

The automation scripts are a result of my hands-on knowledge and experience with Cisco and Mikrotik routers and switches, Cambium APs, and Sonicwall Firewalls. They have been tailored to simplify and streamline network management tasks, allowing for more efficient network operations.
